### Bringing HomeKit support where there is none

Homebridge allows you to integrate with smart home devices that do not natively support HomeKit. There are over 2,000 Homebridge plugins supporting thousands of different smart accessories.

Homebridge is a lightweight Node.js server that you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API.

It supports plugins, which are community-contributed modules that provide a basic bridge from HomeKit to various 3rd-party APIs provided by manufacturers of smart home devices.
